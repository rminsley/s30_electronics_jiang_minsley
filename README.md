# Arduino Vocal Effects Box

## Description 
The Arduino Vocal Effects Box is a real-time digital signal processor that distorts audio signals using an Arduino. It samples audio from a microphone, the audio signal is then manipulated digitally by the Arduino, the signal is then converted to analog, and finally output through a speaker. The Arduino code used used to distort sound relies on a technique called granular synthesis. The code programs the Arduino to divide up incoming sound into small sized samples (grains) that it can then store and manipulate.
